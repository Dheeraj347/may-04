Introduction to the MySQL ORDER BY clause

When you use the SELECT statement to query data from a table,
 the order of rows in the result set is unspecifie
 
Order by
:-
Suppose that you want to sort the sales orders based on their statuses in the following order:

To do this, you can use the FIELD() function to map each order status 
to a number and sort the result by the result of the FIELD() function:

SELECT 
    orderNumber, status
FROM
    orders
ORDER BY FIELD(status,
        'In Process',
        'On Hold',
        'Cancelled',
        'Resolved',
        'Disputed',
        'Shipped');
        
        
        
        SELECT customerName,state
        from customers
        order by  field(state,'CA');


   Summary
   Use the ORDER BY clause to sort the result set by one or more columns.
   Use the ASC option to sort the result set in ascending order and the DESC 
   option to sort the result set in descending order.
   The ORDER BY clause is evaluated after the FROM and SELECT clauses.
   In MySQL, NULL is lower than non-NULL values
